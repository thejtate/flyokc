          <h4>Military welcome center</h4>

          <p>
            The YMCA Military Welcome Center (MWC) at Will Rogers World Airport is located in Bay O of the cargo annex, just
            130 yards outside the side exit by Baggage Claim 1. The Welcome Center offers a restful and relaxing atmosphere
            for traveling military members from all branches, active or retired. The center provides refreshment, internet
            access, long-distance phone service, stamps and stationery, games and hi-definition satellite TV on a big
            screen.
            The MWC is a collaboration between four entities: the City of Oklahoma City, Will Rogers World Airport, the
            Armed Services YMCA, and the Earlywine Park YMCA. The center operates primarily with the help of volunteers and
            community donations. The caring volunteers strive to provide a home-like atmosphere for the travelers, and
            vendors such as Pepsi Bottling Group and BOINGO, provide drinks and internet usage.
