      <h4>ADVERTISING AT WRWA</h4>

      <p>
        All in-terminal advertising is managed by Clear Channel Airports (CCA). Clear Channel Airports has designed a
        program unique to Will Rogers World Airport.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept behind the program is to showcase businesses, attractions, and character of the region. In 2010, CCA
        launched the Community and Corporate Showcase program with an array of new display options that utilize new
        technologies as well as upgraded versions of the old classics. The innovative designs maximize the visual
        advertising effects on the 3.5 million passengers, who utilize the terminal each year.
        Some options include:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-with-icon">
        <li><strong>Tension Fabric Displays: </strong>Stretched vinyl fabric held in by a thin metal frame allows individual companies to
          make a dominant, stand out impression.
        </li>
        <li><strong>DPASS:</strong> This Digital Passenger Assistance Service System allows travelers to search and directly connect to
          area accommodations, restaurants, and attractions from the local area through the use of touch screen kiosks.
        </li>
        <li><strong>LCD Network:</strong> A combination of 57” and 70” commercial grade LCD units throughout the arrivals and bag claim
          area provide hi-definition advertising and the flexibility to change out artwork without incurring artwork
          production costs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flysmart Mobile Phone Application:</strong> A brand new application for smart phones allows travelers direct-connect
          access to local business even once they leave the airport property. Flysmart works as an extension of our
          DPASS unit.
        </li>
      </ul>
