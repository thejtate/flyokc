        playing 30 national dates on the B.B. King Festival Tour.  Following the tour, the Oklahoma City native signed
        with the indie label Shanachie Records teaming up with Kenny Wayne Shepard,  Double Trouble (Stevie RayVaughn's
        band), and producer Kevin Bowe to record Shane’s first album Deliverance.

        Shane's musical style has evolved over the years from a heavy blues-influenced style to what is now an eclectic
        blend of rock, soul, blues and pop. His style is often compared to Tom Petty, The Black Keys. Lenny Kravitz and
        Gary Clark Jr.
        Shane has opened for such notable acts as Etta James, The Neville Brothers, Jonny Lang, Doyle Bramhall II, Edwin
        McCain, Hanson, Joe Bonamassa, Johnny Winter, Grand Funk Railroad and many others. He is currently playing shows
        across the country, from national festivals to popular venues and events. Shane is currently finishing his new
        album, Light in the Dark set to release in the spring of 2016.

        Maggie’s gift for confessional songwriting that’s broad appealing has enabled her music to garner plum synch
        placements. Her songs have appeared in the film Cowgirls N' Angels, and in such television shows as Dr. Phil,
        Cougar Town, The Real World, Worst Prom Ever, The Hills, The City, The Vineyard, and The Young And The Restless.
        As a performer, she’s done a staggering 1000+ shows across the United States. Some live highlights have been
        her holiday halftime performancefeaturing new original "Happiest of Holidays" and National Anthem
        performance (along with Shane Henry) at Madison Square Garden for the NY Knicks December 21, 2015, Main Stage
        Showcases at NACA Nationals, at the Hotel Cafe' in Hollywood, and Rockwood Music Hall (Stage 2) in NYC; on
        separate occasions opening for Sara Bareilles and Tony Lucca; singing the National Anthem at the first NBA
        playoff game in Oklahoma history with more than 18,000 people in attendance, as well as playing the half-time
        show at the Oklahoma City Thunder / Portland Trailblazers game Christmas Eve 2014 along with Shane Henry
        featuring their original Christmas duet, "First Thing On My Christmas List". Additionally, Maggie was a featured
        background extra on Matthew Morrison's (Mr. Schu in Glee)music video for “It Don't Mean A Thing,”, a member
        of Demi Lovato's (and Jordin Sparks/Jason Derulo's) band for the 2013 Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade, and she
        sang the role of Violetta on the English version of Disney Channel Latin America's Violetta (Season 1) that is
        currently airing across the globe. Maggie is a featured vocalist on the new American Girl / Bitty Baby (Mattel)
        "Love From Morning to Night" Album/Book, now available on iTunes and through American Girl Stores. In addition,
        Maggie recently made her sitcom debut on ABC hit show "The Middle" on October 7, 2015 (Season 7, Episode 3) as a
        member of Sue Heck's no-cut a cappella club.
      </p>

      <p>
        A major factor of Maggie’s success—aside from her transcendent artistry—has been her hardworking nature. She is
        completely independent, and assumes the roles of label, booking agent, and manager. “I’m a true believer that if
        you want something to happen, you have to make it happen.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s that roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-to-it ethic that’s enabled her to build a devoted fanbase through doing
        400 shows in the past 3 years. “Each show is a blessing,” Maggie says. “I can’t go up there and push the
        ‘routine’ button. I make each one count and give the audience my best.”
