      <p>
        Filming, videotaping and professional photography is allowed in the airport with a permit from the Department of
        Airports. All activities must be coordinated with the Department and any tenants and airlines that may be
        impacted by the filming or photography session. All Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rules and
        guidelines must be strictly adhered to.
      </p>

      <p>
        To begin the permitting process you will need to provide:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-with-icon list-style-a">
        <li>Script, storyboard, and/or detailed description of the project</li>
        <li>The number of anticipated crew, talent and clients that will be a part of the project</li>
        <li>Day, date, and the anticipated number of hours</li>

      </ul>
