        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-clock"></span>ALLOW plenty of time</h4>

        <p>
          Airline and TSA personnel have noticed an increase in passengers not allowing enough time prior to their
          departure. As a result, people are missing their flights. Passengers are advised to arrive at the terminal
          one-and-a-half hours prior to departure. Remember many airlines now require that passengers and bags be
          checked
          in up to 45 minutes prior to departure. If you are not checked in by that time your seat can be given away.

        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-briefcase"></span>pack smart</h4>

        <p>
          When packing for your trip, think about what items you can carry with you and what items need to be in your
          checked baggage.
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li> The 3-1-1 rule still applies for liquids and gels carried through the security screening checkpoint. This
            means that any liquid, gel or aerosol must
            be in a container with no more than 3.4 ounces in it and all containers must fit into one, clear, zip-top
            bag.
            Only one plastic bag per passenger is
            allowed. The bag must be taken out of your suitcase or carry-on and placed in the plastic bin.
          </li>
          <li> Know what items are allowed in your carry-on bag, what can be packed in your checked baggage and what
            items
            are prohibited. A
            comprehensive list of items prohibited by the Transportation Security Administration can be found at
            tsa.gov.
            Some items may not be a
            security threat but are considered a hazardous material when transported by air such as lighter fluid or
            aerosol
            spray starch. To find out if an item is considered a hazardous or dangerous good, go to
            www.faa.gov/go/packsafe.
          </li>
          <li> Do not overpack and try to keep suitcases as uncluttered as possible.</li>
          <li> Do not to wrap presents before traveling; if a screener cannot determine what the item is or if it needs
            additional inspection, the gift will have to
            be unwrapped.
          </li>
          <li> Be sure to check about carrying special sports equipment like fishing poles, scuba gear or hunting guns.
            A
            complete list of acceptable and
            prohibited items and how to transport them is available at www.tsa.gov

        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-clipboard"></span>know the baggage rules</h4>

        <p>
          Many airlines now charge fees for checked baggage and some even charge for carrryon bags. Be sure to verify
          any
          bag fees with the airline on which you are flying before coming to the airport.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> If the airline allows, check your bag in online. You generally save $3 to $5.</li>
          <li> Make sure that your bag is not over the weight limit, as it may be subject to additional fees.</li>
          <li> If you plan to carry luggage on board, remember that it must be a certain size and you are only allowed
            one
            other personal item such as a purse
            or laptop. Size regulations are listed on the airlines’ websites.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="item">
        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-globe"></span>check in online</h4>

        <p>
          Checking in online will allow you to print your boarding pass and with some airlines, prepay baggage charges.
          This will also save you time at the ticket counter and in many cases save you a couple of dollars on your
          baggage fees. Some airlines have Apps that let you check-in and provide the boarding pass on your mobile
          device.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-car"></span>know where to park</h4>

        <p>
          There are several parking options at Will Rogers World Airport. Save time and stress by knowing where you are
          going to park in advance. A map and pricing schedule is available here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-user"></span>have proper identification</h4>

        <p>Be sure to have a government-issued ID, such as your driver’s license, to pass through the checkpoint. Your
          name must match the exact name on your airline ticket. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Remember if you are traveling out of the country, including Canada and Mexico, you will need a
            passport.
          </li>
          <li> Children under 18 do not require identification.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-badge"></span>be ready for the checkpoint</h4>

        <p>Being ready to pass through the checkpoint not only helps you get through more quickly, but helps the entire
          line move faster. Remember:
          Laptops must be removed from their bags and placed in a bin with nothing else.</p>

        <ul>
          <li> The zip-top bag with your liquids and gels must be removed from your suitcase, purse or briefcase and
            placed in a bin where it is clearly visible
            to screeners.
          </li>
          <li> Shoes, jackets and sweaters must be removed and placed in a bin.</li>
          <li> Minimize heavy jewelry or wearing items that could alarm at the checkpoint such as jeans with sequins or
            studs.
          </li>
          <li> The Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) requires divesting everything that could show up as an anomoly
            including wallets, glasses, etc.
          </li>
          <li> TSA has implemented more random screenings at the checkpoints, so you may be asked to have your hand
            swabbed (a simple swipe on the
            hands) or your bags may undergo additional screening.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Being checkpoint ready can also include enrollment in he TSA Pre✓™ (Precheck) program. Click here to learn
          more
          about the expedited screening benefits offered in the program. Enrollment is $85. Fingerprinting and two forms
          of valid government identification are required. The TSA Pre✓™ enrollment center in Oklahoma City accepts
          walk-ins but you can pre-enroll and schedule an appointment by visiting tsa.gov.

        </h4>

        <p>
          Books, games, laptops and snacks are great diversions and help pass time on the ground and in the air.

        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-home"></span>leave an itinerary at home</h4>

        <p>
          Sounds like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many times a traveler cannot be reached in an emergency
          situation because no one knows where to reach them. Be sure to leave a copy of your flight itinerary, hotel
          name
          and phone number and other pertinent information with a friend or family member.

        <h4><span class="ico ss-icon ss-glyphish-filled ss-smile"></span>be patient</h4>

        <p>
          Weather can always be unpredictable at any time of year, so there is always the possibility of delays. Be
          prepared with activities and snacks for you and your family.
