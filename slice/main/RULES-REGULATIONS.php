        <h4>Department of Airports Key Staff</h4>

        <p>
          In recognizing the necessity of protecting the public health, safety, and interest in the Oklahoma City-owned
          airports, and in order to foster, encourage, and insure the economic growth and orderly development of
          Aeronautical Activities, pursuant to Federal Aviation Administration requirements for federally obligated
          airports, the Oklahoma City Airport Trust has adopted the following :
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Airport Strategic Development Program â€“ Will Rogers World Airport</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This program identifies commercial development opportunities for Airport properties and establishes a business
          planning approach for the leasing of the properties at the Airport, including the development of vacant land
          located on the east side of the Airport property.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the existing Minimum Standards for Aeronautical Activities and Leasing of Land and Facilities
          at Oklahoma City Airports, this Program includes components designed to provide flexibility to changing market
          conditions related to development of Airport property, changes to federal, state and local laws and
          regulations pertaining to Airport development, the dynamics of the aviation industry, and economic forces
          affecting commercial development. These components include the following:
        </p>

        <p>
         <strong>Commercial Land Leasing Policy</strong>, which provides the criteria for non-aviation commercial uses, such as retail,
          office, industrial, and commercial air cargo
        </p>
