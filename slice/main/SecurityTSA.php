      <h4>DO YOUR PART TO MAKE SECURITY SCREENING FAST FOR EVERYONE</h4>

      <p>
        TSA is responsible for screening every passenger and every bag that boards a plane at Will Rogers World Airport.
        Their vital task is to ensure the safety of every traveller.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing security regulations can speed your trip through airport passenger screening. For information about the
        latest security guidelines, questions about baggage screening, lists of items allowed or prohibited in baggage,
        visit the Transportation Security Administration's website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Will Rogers World Airport has two passenger screening checkpoints located on either end of the ticket lobby. At
        these locations, TSA security officers will process you and your carry-on bag, To proceed through screening, you
        will need a current government-issued ID and a valid boarding pass.
      </p>

    <strong> Prepare for screening:</strong>
      <ul>

        <li> Learn what you can take in a carry-on bag prior to packing</li>
        <li> Have liquids and gels in containers of 3.4 ounces or less, and have the containers in a one, quart-sized,
          zip-top plastic bag. See the
          3-1-1 Rule.
        </li>
        <li> Remove the plastic bag from your carry-on bag and put it in a screening bin</li>
        <li> Remove all objects from your pockets, including non-metal objects like a wallet or a pack of gum. Place all
          valuables or small items i
          In your carry-on bag.
        </li>
        <li> Put laptop computers in a screening bin</li>
        <li> Remove shoes, jackets, hoodies, sweaters, scarves and belts and put them in screening bins</li>
        <li> Follow TSA Officer Instructions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT):</strong> <br/>
        Proven to be a highly effective means of detecting dangerous items such as weapons and explosives, the TSA has
        installed several Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) machines at Will Rogers World Airport. The machines are
        called
        millimeter wave and use harmless electromagnetic waves to detect items that could be a threat (the energy
        projected is thousands of times less a cell phone transmission!) These machines do not display specific images
        of
        a passenger’s body, only a generic outline that is the same for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The millimeter wave technology meets all known national and international health and safety standards. The
        screening is safe for all passengers, including children, pregnant women, and individuals with medical implants.
        AIT screening is optional; however, if a passenger chooses not to use the machine, they will receive alternative
        screening, including a physical pat-down.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What to expect:</strong> <br/>
        The procedure for using the AIT is simple: a passenger steps into the imaging portal, stands in position for a
        few
        seconds while the machine creates an image, then steps out. Should the machine detect an item concealed under a
        passenger’s clothing, the machine generates a generic image, similar to a gingerbread man, with a box around the
        area of concern. At that point, a TSA officer determines if additional screening is needed. If the machine
        detects
        no anomalies, a green box with the words “OK” appears on the screen. The entire process is conducted in the
        presence of the passenger.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> Additional Notes:</strong> <br/>
        Do not leave bags unattended. Unattended bags will be confiscated and may be destroyed. If you notice an
        unattended item or suspicious activity, immediately report it to airport personnel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, whether you are arriving or departing from Will Rogers World Airport, all baggage and vehicles are
        subject to search at any time.
