          Shuttle lots
        </h4>

        <p>
          In the shuttle lots, the handicap spaces are located next to the pickup shelters. One ADA accessible van is
          always in circulation. Should a non-accessible van pull up to the pickup shelter, the bus driver will
          immediately call for an accessible van to come to that station. The bus will drop you off on the ticketing
          level. Pickup is located in the transportation plaza on the baggage claim level.
