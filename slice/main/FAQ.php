              <strong> Currently, your Oklahoma driver's license is an acceptable form of ID.</strong> <br/>
              WRWA staff has received a lot of questions regarding the REAL ID Act. Oklahoma travelers want to know if
              they can use their Oklahoma driver’s license as identification when they fly. On October 14, 2015, the
              Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that the State of Oklahoma has received a one year
              extension
              through October 10, 2016.
              If the State of Oklahoma does not receive another extension in October, passengers with Oklahoma driver's
              licenses will be required to have a passport beginning January 22, 2018. Airport staff is uncertain if the
              State will receive another extension as no progress was made toward compliance in the 2016 legislative
              session.
            </p>

              More information about the REAL ID enforcement can be found on the Department of Homeland Security
              website.
